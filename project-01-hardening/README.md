# Project 01 – Endpoint Hardening

## Objective
Apply baseline hardening techniques to a Windows endpoint to reduce attack surface and improve security posture.

## Scope
- Local user management
- OS security configuration
- Firewall and antivirus
- Disk encryption
- Logging and auditing

## Environment
- OS: Windows 10/11
- Type: Local machine / Virtual Machine
- Tools: Built-in Windows security features

## Methodology
1. Created separate administrator and standard user accounts
2. Enabled User Account Control (UAC) at maximum level
3. Verified firewall activation across all network profiles
4. Ensured antivirus and real-time protection were active
5. Applied system updates
6. Enabled disk encryption (BitLocker)
7. Activated security auditing and reviewed logs

## Results
The endpoint was successfully hardened using baseline security controls, reducing the risk of privilege escalation, malware execution, and data exposure.

## Conclusions
Baseline hardening significantly improves endpoint security with minimal operational impact and should be applied as a standard control.

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of least privilege
- Value of logging and visibility
- Security does not always require third-party tools
